# Regex-HTML-CSS-JS
Explanation of the Code:
1. HTML: The HTML file contains a form with input fields for Name, Email, Phone
Number, Event Date, and Number of Tickets. Each input field is accompanied by an
error message container.
2. CSS: The CSS file styles the form, ensuring it is centred on the page, responsive,
and visually appealing. The background colour, form group margins, and button
styles are defined to enhance the user experience.
3. JavaScript: The JavaScript file validates each input field using regular expressions:
○ Name: Validates that the name contains only letters and spaces.
○ Email: Validates the email format.
○ Phone Number: Validates the phone number format (123) 456-7890.
○ Event Date: Validates the date format MM/DD/YYYY.
○ Number of Tickets: Validates that the number of tickets is between 1 and 10
